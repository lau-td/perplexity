[00:00:00.520] --> [00:00:04.640]: Very recently scientists discovered that  your body is teeming with trillions of
[00:00:04.639] --> [00:00:10.039]: the most bizarre viruses – these viruses are  not your enemies but critical to your health,
[00:00:10.039] --> [00:00:15.139]: protecting you from disease, maybe even  killing cancer. A new frontier of sci
[00:00:15.140] --> [00:00:18.440]: ence, something truly new that  we are only just beginning to
[00:00:18.440] --> [00:00:22.807]: understand. Let us dive into the  wild world of the human virome.
[00:00:23.600] --> [00:00:25.623]: You are an Ecosystem
[00:00:25.960] --> [00:00:34.039]: You're a living, breathing ecosystem made of up  to 40 trillion cells. This metropolis of flesh is
[00:00:34.039] --> [00:00:40.479]: home to the human microbiome, another 40 trillion  bacteria that have a contract with your body:
[00:00:40.479] --> [00:00:45.279]: They get to live here and in return they  break down your meals. They synthesise
[00:00:45.280] --> [00:00:50.120]: vitamins in your gut, neutralise acid in  your mouth, help balance your immune system,
[00:00:50.119] --> [00:00:54.799]: and they take up space preventing  harmful bacteria from getting in.
[00:00:54.799] --> [00:01:00.199]: This is a fragile balance – bacteria really  only look out for themselves, multiplying
[00:01:00.200] --> [00:01:03.400]: and testing their boundaries.  To keep their numbers in check,
[00:01:03.399] --> [00:01:07.000]: your body's ecosystem needs  a group of deadly predators:
[00:01:07.000] --> [00:01:10.239]: Viruses. At least ten trillion.
[00:01:10.239] --> [00:01:14.471]: They're literally everywhere in your body,  tens of thousands of different species.
[00:01:14.471] --> [00:01:18.640]: At least a few trillion live in your gut,  where also most of your resident bacteria
[00:01:18.640] --> [00:01:24.239]: are. At least 18 billion on your skin,  100 million in each drop of your saliva,
[00:01:24.239] --> [00:01:29.239]: dozens of millions in your urinary tract.  Even in a single drop of the cerebrospinal
[00:01:29.239] --> [00:01:34.479]: fluid surrounding your nerves and brain,  researchers found up to 10,000 viruses.
[00:01:34.480] --> [00:01:37.079]: While this sounds like a horrible idea at first,
[00:01:37.079] --> [00:01:42.319]: at least in the gut, around 97% of  them are bacteriophages, or phages,
[00:01:42.319] --> [00:01:46.479]: bizarre creatures that are specialised in  hunting down and killing resident bacteria
[00:01:46.480] --> [00:01:52.880]: and are not able to infect your cells. Instead  they kill trillions of bacteria every single day.
[00:01:52.879] --> [00:01:58.231]: Together these viruses make up the human  virome – a symbiotic virus ecosystem that
[00:01:58.231] --> [00:02:02.640]: is completely unique to you and that seems  to be crucial for your health. Let’s get to
[00:02:02.640] --> [00:02:06.987]: know them and see how they support you  – and what happens if things go wrong.
[00:02:07.560] --> [00:02:09.996]: The Silent Mass Murderers of Your Body
[00:02:10.479] --> [00:02:15.519]: Inside your gut, a stealthy Lambda Phage  floats through the buzzing crowds of bacteria,
[00:02:15.520] --> [00:02:21.640]: looking for a victim. It has six legs, a long thin  body and a big head, made of geometric shapes,
[00:02:21.639] --> [00:02:26.799]: filled with genetic material. Each species is  specialized in hunting one specific species
[00:02:26.800] --> [00:02:32.360]: of bacteria and ignores all others.  Lambda is looking for Escherichia coli.
[00:02:32.360] --> [00:02:37.240]: This versatile bacteria is numerous in your  gut, usually a good boy synthesising vitamins
[00:02:37.240] --> [00:02:42.840]: for you. But it also has a dark side – some of  them would much rather live inside your flesh
[00:02:42.840] --> [00:02:47.560]: and feast on your resources. If there are too  many or if they manage to invade your tissue,
[00:02:47.560] --> [00:02:52.280]: they can cause serious diseases. So one  of the most important jobs of the virome
[00:02:52.280] --> [00:02:57.000]: is to control the numbers of different  bacteria populations. By killing them.
[00:02:57.000] --> [00:03:03.199]: Lambda has found a victim. Spider-like legs get  a hold of a bacteria and grip it hard. Like an
[00:03:03.199] --> [00:03:09.280]: angry syringe it violently rams its sharp bottom  into the victim’s body and releases its DNA and
[00:03:09.280] --> [00:03:13.800]: Once inside, the proteins disable the  defenses of the bacterium. It is now
[00:03:13.800] --> [00:03:18.040]: a factory under new management. It  is forced to build new viruses until
[00:03:18.039] --> [00:03:23.159]: the victim is filled up and bursts open,  releasing a horde of fresh Lambda viruses.
[00:03:23.159] --> [00:03:25.759]: But its goal is not genocide.
[00:03:25.759] --> [00:03:30.599]: Phages need a healthy population of bacteria  to survive. So sometimes they choose a way
[00:03:30.599] --> [00:03:35.960]: more sinister tactic. Instead of killing their  victim, the virus integrates its DNA into the
[00:03:35.960] --> [00:03:42.159]: genome of the bacteria and goes to sleep. When the  bacteria multiplies, the virus DNA is multiplied
[00:03:42.159] --> [00:03:49.560]: too. Until one day the viral DNA re-awakens and  suddenly decides to kill its unsuspecting victim.
[00:03:49.560] --> [00:03:54.439]: And here things become exciting – your  virome also needs you to thrive. It’s in
[00:03:54.439] --> [00:04:00.079]: its best interest that you are healthy. So some  viruses inject genes into bacteria that actively
[00:04:00.080] --> [00:04:05.520]: make them support your body. Some force their  bacteria hosts to support your gut’s mucus layer,
[00:04:05.520] --> [00:04:08.840]: break down complex carbohydrates  from your food more efficiently,
[00:04:08.840] --> [00:04:11.840]: creating substances that  protect against inflammation.
[00:04:11.840] --> [00:04:17.720]: And they alter what signals bacteria send to your  immune cells. Basically they’re letting them know:
[00:04:17.720] --> [00:04:21.440]: We have things under control, you  can chill out. This may prevent
[00:04:21.439] --> [00:04:25.879]: allergic reactions or even protect  you against autoimmune diseases.
[00:04:25.879] --> [00:04:30.920]: But of course, there is also a dark side to  this story. Some viruses don’t care about
[00:04:30.920] --> [00:04:36.552]: our health. Instead of helping they turn  harmless bacteria into deadly monsters.
[00:04:36.920] --> [00:04:40.420]: When Viruses turn Bacteria into killers
[00:04:40.920] --> [00:04:45.439]: Some species of bacteriophage carry  dangerous genes for toxic substances.
[00:04:45.439] --> [00:04:49.040]: When they take over their hosts, they  can integrate into the genetic code of
[00:04:49.040] --> [00:04:54.840]: the bacteria where they lay as a deadly gift. Like the case of the Vibrio cholerae and the
[00:04:54.839] --> [00:04:59.839]: CTXφ bacteriophage hunting them. Most  strains of the cholerae bacteria are
[00:04:59.839] --> [00:05:06.039]: harmless and billions of them may live in your  gut right now. When CTXφ infect the bacteria,
[00:05:06.040] --> [00:05:10.040]: they gift them the genes for the cholera  toxin, which permanently becomes part of
[00:05:10.040] --> [00:05:14.879]: their genetic lineage forever. It's  like handing a house cat a shotgun.
[00:05:14.879] --> [00:05:20.040]: Vibrio cholerae shower these toxins at the  cells lining your gut, making them sick. They
[00:05:20.040] --> [00:05:24.680]: vomit large amounts of salt, which pulls out  a flood of water into your intestines. This
[00:05:24.680] --> [00:05:29.720]: causes explosive diarrhoea and vomiting,  draining your body of fluid. If untreated,
[00:05:29.720] --> [00:05:35.000]: about half of patients die. But for the  phage and bacteria this is great. They are
[00:05:35.000] --> [00:05:40.360]: carried out of the body to infect more humans,  spreading and multiplying further. This strain
[00:05:40.360] --> [00:05:45.199]: of Vibrio cholerae is now a dangerous  enemy of humanity thanks to this virus.
[00:05:45.199] --> [00:05:52.399]: Or the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, which is  hunted by the phage with the amazing name: φSa3ms.
[00:05:52.399] --> [00:05:56.799]: Usually the bacteria is mostly harmless  and lives on your skin and inside your
[00:05:56.800] --> [00:06:01.480]: nose. It doesn’t do anything useful per  se, its main job is to take up space,
[00:06:01.480] --> [00:06:07.360]: making it harder for hostile bacteria to  colonise your body. But φSa3ms can change this
[00:06:07.360] --> [00:06:13.720]: quickly – it carries multiple dangerous genes,  like giving a cat flamethrowers and grenades.
[00:06:13.720] --> [00:06:18.440]: If such a modified Staphylococcus aureus  bacteria gets into your body through a tiny cut,
[00:06:18.439] --> [00:06:24.120]: it becomes extremely dangerous. One of its new  weapons are superantigens, which basically is
[00:06:24.120] --> [00:06:29.160]: like injecting your immune cells with cocaine.  The toxin completely breaks your carefully fine
[00:06:29.160] --> [00:06:34.800]: tuned immune system. It activates all of your  T cells, all at once and makes them flip out.
[00:06:34.800] --> [00:06:40.400]: They release a tsunami of cytokines, activating  all of your defenses at once. The infection is
[00:06:40.399] --> [00:06:45.239]: flooded with cells that can’t fight the  bacteria and cause heavy inflammation.
[00:06:45.240] --> [00:06:50.560]: Your broken and confused immune cells have a  really hard time fighting Staphylococcus aureus,
[00:06:50.560] --> [00:06:55.839]: which now invades, penetrating deep into your  tissue. Your body is trying to seal the wounds
[00:06:55.839] --> [00:06:59.839]: and isolate the invader, but another new  weapon it gained has the ability to just
[00:06:59.839] --> [00:07:05.119]: dissolve the barriers and penetrate even deeper.  Before the onset of antibiotics an infection
[00:07:05.120] --> [00:07:11.879]: with Staphylococcus aureus was very deadly and we  have φSa3ms to thank for making it even deadlier.
[00:07:11.879] --> [00:07:18.324]: But the viruses of our virome may also  directly save your life – by killing cancer.
[00:07:19.000] --> [00:07:20.737]: Cancer Killing Viruses
[00:07:21.120] --> [00:07:26.199]: Oncolytic viruses specialize in hunting and  killing cancer – like the Newcastle Disease
[00:07:26.199] --> [00:07:32.159]: virus or the Reovirus, who mostly ignore your  healthy cells and instead hunt down tumors.
[00:07:32.160] --> [00:07:36.840]: Cancer cells are broken mutants that evolve  various ways to hide and fight back against
[00:07:36.839] --> [00:07:41.319]: your immune system. But as they get better  at this, they get worse at other things,
[00:07:41.319] --> [00:07:47.279]: like fighting back viruses. A weakness to  be exploited. Oncolytic viruses target the
[00:07:47.279] --> [00:07:52.319]: specific adaptations of cancer cells, hitting  them where they are not ready to be hit.
[00:07:52.319] --> [00:07:56.279]: And worse for these cells, since their  internal machinery is compromised,
[00:07:56.279] --> [00:08:01.759]: they can’t defend themselves. They are taken  over and turned into virus production factories.
[00:08:01.759] --> [00:08:06.680]: Eventually the new viruses leave the cancer cell,  often killing it, and carry on infecting other
[00:08:06.680] --> [00:08:12.000]: cancer cells nearby. This death and destruction  is not subtle, and one side effect is that
[00:08:12.000] --> [00:08:16.800]: it attracts immune cells that immediately  begin attacking the tumor with full force.
[00:08:16.800] --> [00:08:20.759]: What is even more impressive, these  viruses seem to disrupt the artificial
[00:08:20.759] --> [00:08:24.920]: environment that tumors create to keep  your immune system at bay. Oncolytic
[00:08:24.920] --> [00:08:29.520]: viruses are like infiltrators in a city  at siege, opening the gates while killing
[00:08:29.519] --> [00:08:34.079]: defenders left and right – helping  your immune cells to win the fight.
[00:08:34.080] --> [00:08:40.680]: In 2024 we don’t know yet to what degree oncolytic  viruses are part of your virome or more of a happy
[00:08:40.679] --> [00:08:46.000]: accident. But they seem to go well together with  chemotherapy or radiation. Eventually they may
[00:08:46.000] --> [00:08:51.960]: become an important new tool to enable us to  eliminate cancer and save millions of lives.
[00:08:51.960] --> [00:08:55.480]: We don’t know what we will learn in the  next few years, but we now know that there
[00:08:55.480] --> [00:09:00.720]: are trillions of potential allies within  us, killing and manipulating, for better
[00:09:00.720] --> [00:09:04.596]: or worse. What an exciting time to be alive.
[00:09:12.109] --> [00:09:14.600]: Well, that was an interesting ride! Are there
